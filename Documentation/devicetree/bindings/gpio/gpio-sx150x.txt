SEMTECH SX150x GPIO expander bindings


Required properties:

- compatible: should be "semtech,sx1506q",
			"semtech,sx1508q",
			"semtech,sx1509q",
			"semtech,sx1502q".

- reg: The I2C slave address for this device.

- interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller.

- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.

- #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the
		second cell is used to specify optional parameters:
		bit 0: polarity (0: normal, 1: inverted)

- gpio-controller: Marks the device as a GPIO controller.

- interrupt-controller: Marks the device as a interrupt controller.

Optional Properties:
- oscio-is-gpo: Boolean, Indicated the oscio pin can be used as additional
		output gpo port.

- pull-up-ports: Array of port numbers which must have pull-up enabled.
- pull-down-ports: Array of port numbers which must have pull-down enabled.
- open-drain-ports: Array of port numbers which must be configured as open-drain,
			Push-Pull mode is default.
- polarity-invert-ports: Array of port numbers whih port polarity must be inverted.
- probe-reset: Boolean, Indicates the expander must be resetted.

The GPIO expander can optionally be used as an interrupt controller, in
which case it uses the default two cell specifier as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.

Example:

	i2c_gpio_expander@20{
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "semtech,sx1506q";
		reg = <0x20>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio_1>;
		interrupts = <16 0>;

		gpio-controller;
		interrupt-controller;

		pull-up-ports = <0 12>;
		pull-down-ports = <1 8>;
		open-drain-ports = <6 7 11>;
		polarity-invert-ports = <3>;
		probe-reset;
	};
