Cadence USB2.0 Device Controller

The Cadence USB2.0 Device Controller as verilog IP core library.

Required properties:
- compatible	: Should be "cdns,usbhs-udc"
- reg		: Physical base address and size of the USB2
			device registers map.
- interrupts	: Should contain single irq line of USB2 device
			controller
- cdns,ep-in	: Should be an array of u32 containing 1 for each available
			IN endpoint, endpoint 0 is mandatory,
			0 means not available, 16 entries max
- cdns,ep-out	: Should be an array of u32 containing 1 for each available
			OUT endpoint, endpoint 0 is mandatory
			0 means not available, 16 entries max
- cdns,ep-in-size	: Should be an array of u32 containing the max buffer
				size available for each IN endpoint,
				i.e. 64 for EP0, 512 for BULK, 1024 for ISO
- cdns,ep-in-buffers	: Should be an array of u32 containing the buffer
				count available for each IN endpoint,
				i.e. 1 for EP0 or BULK, 2 to 4 for ISO
- cdns,ep-in-buffstart	: Should be an array of u32 containing the buffer
				start offset for each IN endpoint
- cdns,ep-out-size	: Should be an array of u32 containing the max buffer
				size available for each OUT endpoint,
				i.e. 64 for EP0, 512 for BULK, 1024 for ISO
- cdns,ep-out-buffers	: Should be an array of u32 containing the buffer
				count available for each OUT endpoint,
				i.e. 1 for EP0 or BULK, 2 to 4 for ISO
- cdns,ep-out-buffstart	: Should be an array of u32 containing the buffer
				start offset for each OUT endpoint

Optional Properties :
- cdns,dma-enable	: Present of dma is present and must be enabled
- cdns,dma-channels	: If cdns,dma-enable is present, should be an u32
				containing the count of DMA channels
- clocks		: Should contain a phandle to the bus clock to enable

Example :
	usbd@80402000 {
		compatible = "cdns,usbhs-udc";
		interrupts = <25>;
		reg = <0x80402000 0x1000>;
		cdns,ep-in = <1 1 1>;
		cdns,ep-out = <1 1 1>;
		cdns,ep-in-size = <64 512 512>;
		cdns,ep-out-size = <64 512 512>;
		cdns,ep-in-buffers = <1 1 1>;
		cdns,ep-out-buffers = <1 1 1>;
		cdns,ep-in-buffstart = <0 64 576>;
		cdns,ep-out-buffstart = <0 64 576>;
		cdns,dma-enable;
		cdns,dma-channels = <4>;
	};
