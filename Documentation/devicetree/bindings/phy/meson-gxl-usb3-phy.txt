* Amlogic Meson GXL and GXM USB3 PHY binding

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy"
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- #phys-cells:	should be 0 (see phy-bindings.txt in this directory)
- interrupts:	describes the OTG device/host mode detection interrupt
- phys:		a list of related PHYs (typically the USB2 PHYs, see
		meson-gxl-usb2-phy.txt in this directory). The mode of
		the listed PHYs will be managed by the USB3 PHY (which
		is required for OTG device/host detection to work).
		The number of PHYs listed typically matches the number
		of ports which are enabled in the USB controller which
		uses this PHY.

Optional properties:
- phy-supply:	see phy-bindings.txt in this directory


Example:
	usb3_phy0: phy@78080 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x0 0x78080 0x0 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usb2_phys 0>, <&usb2_phys 1>;
	};
