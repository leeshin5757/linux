This describes the USB2 PHY block which provides multiple USB2 PHY ports.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb2-phy"
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- #phys-cells:	should be 1 (see phy-bindings.txt in this directory)
- clocks:	phandle and clock identifier for the phy clocks
- clock-names:	"usb" and "usb_ddr"
- resets:	reference to the reset controller

Optional properties:
- phy-supply:	see phy-bindings.txt in this directory


Example:
	usb2_phys: phy@78000 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb2-phy";
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		reg = <0x0 0x78000 0x0 0x80>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_USB1>, <&clkc CLKID_USB1_DDR_BRIDGE>;
		clock-names = "usb", "usb_ddr";
		resets = <&reset RESET_USB_OTG>;
	};
